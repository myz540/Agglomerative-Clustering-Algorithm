This project was created for CS201 for Umass Lowell Fall 2015 under Professor Anna Rumshisky.

The project contains the source code for an agglomerative clustering algorithm, which takes in a set of points in 2-d euclidian space and
performs agglomerative clustering until a specified number of clusters has been reached.
